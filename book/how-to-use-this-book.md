<h1>如何使用這本書</h1>

<h2>本書結構</h2>

<p>本書章節基本上以資料如何被視覺化的實際操作作區分<s>（除非不是）</s>，從問卷設計到資料搜集再到最終的視覺化等等。The book&rsquo;s chapters follow pretty closely the actual set of steps that need to be accomplished before data can be visualized, from the design of the survey to the collection of the data to ultimately its visualization. Really pretty simple. So if you&rsquo;re fairly new to the game, it is probably going to make sense for you to start at the beginning and read the whole way through the book. Likewise, if you&rsquo;re familiar with some of the content, but not everything, there&rsquo;s no harm in just skipping to the chapters that are relevant to your case: you aren&rsquo;t going to be scrambling to catch up if you skip around!</p>

<div data-type="warning">
<p>如果你對問卷設計、資料搜集和視覺化僅略懂皮毛（甚至毫無概念）的話，我們強烈建議你先讀畢此書再進行資料搜集。某些視覺化需要詳進的討論及規劃，如果你依序閱讀本書，你將極有可能在<s>抵達公海</s>問題出現之前及早發現並作出適當處理，善哉善哉！</p>
</div>

<h2>常見名詞及定義</h2>

<p>透過此書，我們會多次在特定主題内談及專有詞彙，此乃正常能量釋放。若遇以上情形，請你勿慌、勿急、勿戰，我們會於文中提供連結至<a class="glossterm" href="glossary01.html#" target="_blank">專有詞彙</a>解説頁面。歡迎你隨時閱讀這份參考資料，而我們則會力盡所能在提及新的專有詞彙時引導你至該處，已收無縫接軌之效。</p>

<h2>進階章節</h2>

<p>此書含有我們認為超出常人應該理解的進階章節，因此我們會在這些章節開首標註警示，好讓你了解。雖然這些章節僅為選讀部分（但我們強烈建議要讀！），泛泛之輩無視即可，但This book does contain some chapters that go a bit above and beyond just the basics that we think you should know. We do denote these chapters with a warning at the beginning of the chapter so that you know to expect a more in-depth look at the topic. Reading these chapters (although we recommend it!) is not necessary for an adequate understanding of the broader topic being discussed; however, there are times when we feel that it&rsquo;s useful to provide you with easy access to the information and that you could benefit from a more thorough understanding of the topic.</p>

<h2>Examples: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</h2>

<p>One of our favorite parts about this book (although maybe we&rsquo;re a little biased) is the examples that we use throughout: many of these concepts can get kind of abstract and having a concrete example to refer to really helps to keep things straight. That said, there are a few different styles that we use to indicate good and bad examples, dos and don&rsquo;ts, etc.</p>

<table class="custom question-and-answer">
        <tbody>
                <tr>
      <th>問題</th>
                        <th>解答</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>欲尋何事？</td>
      <td>解答居此。</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>好的例子</h3>

<p>Good examples are always accompanied by a green or blue bar, a checkmark, or a thumbs-up symbol, depending on what&rsquo;s being presented (a graphic, a data table, a procedure, something else).</p>

<h3>Bad Examples</h3>

<p>Conversely, whenever we illustrate what <strong>not</strong> to do in a given situation, we will include a gray bar or cross out the example with a large X or include a thumbs-down symbol to accompany it. These different styles will look like:</p>

<table class="custom good-and-bad">
        <tbody>
                <tr>
                        <th>好處</th>
                        <th>壊處</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>裨益位此。</td>
      <td>禍害於此。</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<table class="custom yes-and-no">
        <tbody>
                <tr>
                        <th>Do</th>
                        <th>Don't</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>This column lists good tips and advice.</td>
      <td>This column shows what you should avoid.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Sometimes we also mark good and bad examples using images</p>

<figure><img alt="Unclear radio buttons" src="../images/sections/03/correct-ages.png" /></figure>

<p>An image preceded by a gray box with an "x" means that it's a graphical example of a practice that you should avoid.</p>

<figure>
  <h2 class="avoid">This is an example of what not to do</h2>
  <img alt="3D pie" src="../images/sections/01/what-not-to-do.png" />
</figure>

<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>Other times, we will just want to make sure that you&rsquo;re careful and don&rsquo;t forget to consider an important point. When this is the case we will include a warning box, identified by a red exclamation mark. (Actually, we already used one of these up above!)</p>

<h2>作出貢獻或提出修正</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re reading through the book and notice a typo, or think that something is incorrectly or ambiguously explained, or get a great idea for a new section or chapter, let us know! There are two ways to do this: you can either <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/infoactive.us/forms/d/1LsafHUV-BPQHmQsXHR40UsXS4f0c_jySgMrF9vMloF4/viewform?usp=send_form" target="_blank">fill out this form</a> or, if you&rsquo;re a little bit more technical, follow the directions that we have <a href="https://github.com/infoactive/data-design#can-i-make-edits" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you just aren&rsquo;t sure about something after reading about it, ask us for a better explanation! It&rsquo;s likely that we didn&rsquo;t realize that we could have explained it better (but that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t want to!). Tweet us at <a href="http://twitter.com/DataDesignBook" target="_blank">@DataDesignBook</a>, email <a href="mailto:ebook@infoactive.co?subject=Data Design Question" target="_blank">ebook@infoactive.co</a>, or check out <a href="http://helpmeviz.com/" target="_blank">HelpMeViz</a> for even more resources. We&rsquo;ll do our best to get your question squared away and will make sure that future editions do a better job addressing the issue.</p>
